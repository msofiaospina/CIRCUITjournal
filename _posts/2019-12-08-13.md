Summary of Paper: This paper is useful in understanding a simplification for calculating heat transfer. The simplification occurs because of the assumption lamina and compressible 

Opportunity: Being able to calculate the heating a an object going at unpredictable speeds is important. This provides that opportunity. 

Challenge: The main challenge is understanding the values that can be assumed for the non-dimensional parameters like prandtl and sutherland. 

Action: Assuming Prandlt to be 0.75 and the specific heat held constant, we can find results for the heat-transfer and skin friction. 

Resolution: Ultimately, this is very useful in finding the necessary values for heating. Moreover, it's general simplicity has allowed me to integrate it into a Matlab code.

Future/Impact: With the proper heating calculations we will be able to understand better as to how we can change the geometry and more better account for the extreme temperatures.
